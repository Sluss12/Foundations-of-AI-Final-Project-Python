# Foundations-of-AI-Final-Project-Python
For this project, we are making a simple state machine that will be given a start and end state, with from there we are to show the transitory states of the system to achieve the end state. The system will consist of a series of blocks that can be moved to one of three locations, these movements will be controlled by a robot arm.
